\description{
KAMILA is an iterative clustering method that equitably balances the
contribution of continuous and categorical variables.

\details{
KAMILA (KAy-means for MIxed LArge data sets) is an iterative clustering
method that equitably balances the contribution of the continuous and
categorical variables. It uses a kernel density estimation technique to
flexibly model spherical clusters in the continuous domain, and uses a
multinomial model in the categorical domain.

Weighting scheme: If no weights are desired, set all weights to 1 (the
default setting). Let a_1, ..., a_p denote the weights for p continuous
variables. Let b_1, ..., b_q denote the weights for q categorical variables.
 Currently, continuous weights are applied during the calculation of
Euclidean distance, as:
Categorical weights are applied to the log-likelihoods obtained by the
level probabilities given cluster membership as:
Total log likelihood for the kth cluster is obtained by weighting the
single continuous log-likelihood by the mean of all continuous weights
plus logLikCat_k:
Note that weights between 0 and 1 are admissible; weights equal to zero
completely remove a variable's influence on the clustering; weights equal
to 1 leave a variable's contribution unchanged. Weights between 0 and 1
may not be comparable across continuous and categorical variables.
